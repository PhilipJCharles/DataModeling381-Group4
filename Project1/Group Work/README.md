# Modernized EMovies

This is Group 4's submission for the first group project of Peter Heller's Data Modeling course at Queens College.
Included in this submission is our group's .erwin model for a modernized version of EMovies, a data model used earlier in the course. Additionally a .ddl is included that forward engineers the model from Erwin to Sql Server 2019. 

Also included is each individual's previous model submission and the corresponding ddl files.


# Vision
Our goal with this model is to bring EMovies into the 21st century by transforming it into a streaming platform, moving away entirely from the physical side of movie rentals. As such, our submission may be seen as a "proposal" of how this business might structure its data and implement a database.

# Knowledge Demonstrated

Below are some of the competencies demonstrated in this submission:

- Understanding of Erwin Data Modeler
- Understanding of defaults, check constraints, domains
- Understanding of fully qualified entities and domains
- Understanding of parent-child relationships including super and sub types
- Understanding of Erwin's forward engineering functionality to create a database in Sql Server 2019
- Usage of GitHub to develop software in a collaborative environment

# Division of Labor

Philip Charles was the project manager and took a chief role in creating deadlines, collecting submissions, and general management tasks.

Every person took a “subject area” and was responsible for the entities, attributes, relationships, defaults, constraints, etc. of that subject area. Our contributions were combined in the CDM, LDM, and PDM.

Further documentation can be found in the video file explaining each individual’s contribution, as well as the definitions in the Erwin model itself.
